## Introduction

* We were task to help wildfire responders since wildfire has increased over the years. Our TerraGuard is a two board rover with a portable screan that has its own wi-fi to communicate with the rover in real time.

### Project Summary

* The rover has BME688(temperature), MQ-2 gas sensor(detects versatile gases), GPS, and motors for mobility. The screen is CrowPanel EP-32-S3 with led to indicate status of the rover's connection and visual awareness if sensors detect changes to the environment. Full detail of project is in the link [team report.](https://egr314-2025-f-315.github.io/phoenixforce.github.io/)


### My Contribution

* MQ-2 gas sensor:
  Detecting early fire indicators is critical for wildfire prevention system, where even a small ignition can rapidly escalate into a destructive wildfire. Among    verious gas and smoke options. Created code and calibrated to detect gasses by using ratios.
  Rs= Sensor resistance when gas is present
  Ro= Sensor resistance in clean air
* Design rover and display cover:
  designed and 3D printed using SolidWorks. 

To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.
