**Phoenix Force** is an autonomous rover designed to patrol high-risk areas and detect early signs of wildfire (smoke, abnormal temperature rise, and flammable gas concentration) before they become uncontrollable.

The rover uses real-time sensor to identify potential fire threats, geolocate them, and transmit alerts giving firefighters crucial extra minutes to respond.
